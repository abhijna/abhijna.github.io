## Cell Ranger Software Documentation  

As the **lead Software Scientific Writer** for **Chromium Single Cell** products at [10x Genomics](https://www.10xgenomics.com/), I supported the launch of:  
- 9 versions of Cell Ranger  
- 3 versions of Cell Ranger ATAC  
- 3 versions of Cell Ranger ARC  

I developed and maintained a wide range of customer-facing materials, including:  
- Technology introductions  
- Tutorials and analysis guides  
- User manuals and installation instructions  
- Algorithm documentation  
- Release notes  
- Video content and walkthroughs  

This page showcases representative examples from each content type.

### Technology Introduction: Explaining Platform & Options

As a company’s product line expands, it becomes essential to guide users through available technology choices and appropriate use cases. Clear, comprehensive introductory materials help users select the right tools for their experiments.

In the article [What is Sample Multiplexing?](https://www.10xgenomics.com/support/software/cell-ranger/latest/getting-started/cr-3p-what-is-cellplex), I broke down the concept of sample multiplexing and explained the available options for Chromium workflows. I collaborated with a professional illustrator to create informative visuals that reinforce key concepts.

The page features:  
- Thoughtful use of **jump links** for ease of navigation  
- Strategic cross-linking to related **how-to guides**, [**examples**](https://www.10xgenomics.com/support/software/cell-ranger/latest/analysis/running-pipelines/cr-3p-multi#hashing), and [**FAQs**](https://kb.10xgenomics.com/hc/en-us/articles/33451184917389-Can-I-perform-Cell-Hashing-in-a-GEM-X-Universal-3-Gene-Expression-v4-workflow) 
- A user-friendly structure optimized for both new and experienced researchers

### Tutorials and Analysis Guides

The best way to understand a complex software tool is to try it hands-on. I created several step-by-step tutorials using publicly available datasets to help users practice running Cell Ranger pipelines.

Each guide walks users through:
- Downloading and preparing input data
- Configuring parameters and command-line inputs
- Running the pipeline
- Exploring and interpreting output files

These tutorials include **copy-paste-ready commands** and are often paired with **video walkthroughs** to support users who are less familiar with command-line environments.

In this example, users learn how to run Cell Ranger's `multi` command to [analyze single cell immune profiling data](https://www.10xgenomics.com/support/software/cell-ranger/latest/tutorials/cr-tutorial-multi).

Short screen capture videos are especially helpful for customers who are new to command-line workflows.


In addition to writing core documentation for Cell Ranger, I contributed to a collection of guides and articles that help users analyze data beyond the scope of 10x Genomics software.

These resources include:
- [Introductions](https://www.10xgenomics.com/analysis-guides/immune-profiling-analysis-whats-next-after-cell-ranger) to downstream analysis concepts
- [Step-by-step tutorials](https://www.10xgenomics.com/analysis-guides/demultiplexing-and-analyzing-5%E2%80%99-immune-profiling-libraries-pooled-with-hashtags) for custom workflows
- [Blog-style content](https://www.10xgenomics.com/analysis-guides/mixcr-single-cell-immune-repertoire-analysis) for third-party tools like MiXCR

These materials were created to help customers extend their analyses using external software tools and workflows, supporting a wide range of research needs and increasing overall user success.

### Installation Guides and System Requirements

Clear installation instructions and system requirements are essential for helping users get up and running quickly. These documents reduce support requests by ensuring that users have the necessary hardware, software, and dependencies in place before running the software. A well-written installation guide can make the difference between a smooth onboarding experience and early frustration.

Here are some examples of my work:
- [System Requirements for Cell Ranger](https://www.10xgenomics.com/support/software/cell-ranger/downloads/cr-system-requirements)
- [Cell Ranger Installation Guide](https://www.10xgenomics.com/support/software/cell-ranger/latest/tutorials/cr-tutorial-in)


### Technology Usage Guide: Man Pages

Good technical documentation supports users with varying levels of experience — from beginners to advanced researchers. While introductory content is useful for new users, returning customers often prefer quick-reference materials that let them access commands and parameters directly.

For experienced users of Cell Ranger, I created a [**manual-style reference page**](https://www.10xgenomics.com/support/software/cell-ranger/latest/resources/cr-command-line-arguments) that includes:

- A navigation panel for quick access to each command
- Clear descriptions of available parameters and their usage
- Links to related documentation for further details

This format helps returning users find the information they need efficiently, without scrolling through basic introductory content.

### Algorithm Descriptions

Understanding the algorithms behind an analysis tool helps users interpret their results with confidence. When users know how the software processes data, what assumptions it makes, how it handles edge cases, and how outputs are generated, they can apply the tool more effectively and troubleshoot unexpected results. 

Clear algorithm documentation builds trust and enables advanced users to make informed decisions about experimental design and data interpretation.

To [demystify a complex immune profiling analysis pipeline](https://www.10xgenomics.com/support/software/cell-ranger/latest/algorithms-overview/cr-5p-vdj-algorithm), I paired visual aids with well-structured explanatory text, enabling users to understand what happens behind the scenes.


### Release Notes

Release notes help users understand what has changed between versions. They highlight new features, fixed bugs, and known issues, allowing users to make informed decisions about updating and integrating new functionality into their workflows. Clear, well-organized release notes also reduce confusion and support requests.

Here is an example:
- [Cell Ranger Release Notes](https://www.10xgenomics.com/support/software/cell-ranger/latest/release-notes)


### Technical Notes

In collaboration with cross-functional teams of scientists and engineers, I authored the following technical notes to support product clarity and user success:

- [Sequencing Metrics & Base Composition of Chromium Flex Libraries](https://www.10xgenomics.com/support/flex-gene-expression/documentation/steps/sequencing/sequencing-metrics-base-composition-of-chromium-fixed-rna-profiling-libraries)
- [Interpreting Cell Ranger multi Web Summary Files for Fixed RNA Profiling](https://www.10xgenomics.com/support/flex-gene-expression/documentation/steps/sequencing/interpreting-cell-ranger-multi-web-summary-files-for-fixed-rna-profiling)


### Video Content

Some examples of the video content I was involved in creating:

- [Filtering Gene Expression Clusters by Antigen Specificity Score](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB6mGi2BmHk&t=21s)
- [Filter Clonotypes by Antigen Specificity Score](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwPa0nohlvE)
