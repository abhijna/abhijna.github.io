<span class="fa fa-flask about-icon"></span>
I am a biologist and bioinformatician postdoc in Titus Brown's lab at UC Davis. I am working as part of the NIH Common Fund Data Ecosystem's training and engagement team to develop bioinformatics pipelines and training resources for researchers and clinicians. I am involved in efforts to make NIH data FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable).

<span class="fa fa-code about-icon"></span>
I write code in <strong>R</strong>, <strong>Markdown</strong>, and <strong>BASH</strong>.

<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-cloud"></span>
I can develop workflows in Snakemake and run bioinformatics pipelines in the cloud (AWS, academic HPC).

I also teach/organize several bioinformatics workshops including ones about AWS, Conda, Snakemake and R.

I got my PhD at Michigan State University (2018) where I studied venom resistant voltage-gated sodium ion channels in wild rodents called grasshopper mice. You can learn more about it on my [Research Projects page](./researchprojects.md)
