I started out as a bench biologist — now I write documentation for complex pipelines and technologies. Along the way, I realized that communication is infrastructure. Without clear, accessible content, even the best tools risk becoming barriers to discovery.

I have a PhD in Integrative Biology and a background in bioinformatics, molecular genetics, and neuroscience. What I love most is translating complex ideas into clear, practical documentation that makes technology more accessible.

I’m currently a **Senior Technical Writer at Semgrep (2025)**, where I create documentation that supports developers and security teams using the Semgrep AppSec Platform. My work focuses on improving both clarity and discoverability: I’ve migrated our search experience from Algolia to Meilisearch with AI-powered semantic search, optimized DocuSaurus site navigation using FullStory analytics, and developed product-level introductory content that helps users understand Semgrep’s capabilities at a glance. I also manage documentation workflows in Linear and ensure style consistency across the docs using Vale.

Previously, I worked as a **Senior Scientific Writer at 10x Genomics**, developing technical and scientific content for high-visibility product launches and advanced analytics workflows. Before that, I was a postdoctoral researcher in Titus Brown’s lab at **UC Davis**, contributing to the NIH Common Fund Data Ecosystem through bioinformatics pipeline development, FAIR data initiatives, and community training efforts.

I've designed and led training workshops on AWS, Conda, Snakemake, R, and open science tools, with a focus on accessibility and reproducibility for biomedical researchers.

&#128187;
I write and maintain code in <strong>R</strong>, <strong>Markdown</strong>, and <strong>BASH</strong>, and I’m experienced in version control and collaborative development using Git and GitHub.

I’ve built and run bioinformatics pipelines using Snakemake on cloud platforms like AWS and on academic HPC systems. I’ve also documented cloud-native tools for scalable single-cell analysis.

I got my PhD from Michigan State University, where I studied the molecular evolution of venom resistance in grasshopper mice. Learn more on my [Research Projects](./researchprojects.md) page.

I also have a Masters degree in molecular genetics from the University of Leicester (UK) and a BSc in life sciences and chemistry from Christ University (India).
