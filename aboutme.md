<span class="fa fa-flask about-icon"></span>

I started out as a bench biologist, hands deep in experiments, and somewhere along the way I found my way into writing. Now I write about code, science, and the tools that make both work. I realized that good communication isn't just helpful, it is essential. Without clear, accessible content, even the best scientific tools can end up gathering dust.

I have a PhD in Integrative Biology and a background in bioinformatics, molecular genetics, and neuroscience. What I love most is translating complex ideas into clear, practical documentation that makes science more accessible and people’s work a little easier.

I worked as a Senior Scientific Writer at 10x Genomics, where I developed technical content for high-impact product launches and supported advanced analytics workflows. Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher in Titus Brown’s lab at UC Davis, contributing to the NIH Common Fund Data Ecosystem through bioinformatics pipeline development, FAIR data practices, and community training efforts.

I write and maintain code in <strong>R</strong>, <strong>Markdown</strong>, and <strong>BASH</strong>, and I’m experienced in version control and collaborative development using Git and GitHub.

<span class="material-icons">computer</span>
I design and lead training workshops on AWS, Conda, Snakemake, R, and open science tools, with a focus on accessibility and reproducibility for biomedical researchers.

<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-cloud"></span>
I’ve built and run bioinformatics pipelines using Snakemake on cloud platforms like AWS and on academic HPC systems. I’ve also documented cloud-native tools for scalable single-cell analysis.

I got my PhD from Michigan State University, where I studied the molecular evolution of venom resistance in grasshopper mice. Learn more on my [Research Projects](./researchprojects.md) page.

I also hold an masters degree in Molecular Genetics from the University of Leicester (UK) and a BSc in Life Sciences and Chemistry from Christ University (India).
