I started out as a bench biologist — now I write documentation for complex pipelines and technologies. Along the way, I realized that communication is infrastructure. Without clear, accessible content, even the best tools risk becoming barriers to discovery.

I have a PhD in Integrative Biology and a background in bioinformatics, molecular genetics, and neuroscience. What I love most is translating complex ideas into clear, practical documentation that makes science more accessible and people’s work a little easier.

I worked as a Senior Scientific Writer at 10x Genomics, where I developed technical content for high-impact product launches and supported advanced analytics workflows. Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher in Titus Brown’s lab at UC Davis, contributing to the NIH Common Fund Data Ecosystem through bioinformatics pipeline development, FAIR data practices, and community training efforts.

I've designed and led training workshops on AWS, Conda, Snakemake, R, and open science tools, with a focus on accessibility and reproducibility for biomedical researchers.

&#128187;
I write and maintain code in <strong>R</strong>, <strong>Markdown</strong>, and <strong>BASH</strong>, and I’m experienced in version control and collaborative development using Git and GitHub.

&#128105;&#8205;&#128187;
I’ve built and run bioinformatics pipelines using Snakemake on cloud platforms like AWS and on academic HPC systems. I’ve also documented cloud-native tools for scalable single-cell analysis.

I got my PhD from Michigan State University, where I studied the molecular evolution of venom resistance in grasshopper mice. Learn more on my [Research Projects](./researchprojects.md) page.

I also have a Masters degree in molecular genetics from the University of Leicester (UK) and a BSc in life sciences and chemistry from Christ University (India).
