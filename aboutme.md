<p style="font-size:1.2rem; font-weight:600; margin-bottom:1em;">
I started out as a bench biologist — now I write documentation for complex pipelines and technologies. Along the way, I realized that communication is infrastructure. Without clear, accessible content, even the best tools risk becoming barriers to discovery.
</p>

<p style="font-size:1.1rem; margin-bottom:1.5em;">
I have a PhD in Integrative Biology and a background in bioinformatics, molecular genetics, and neuroscience. What I love most is translating complex ideas into clear, practical documentation that makes science more accessible and people’s work a little easier.
